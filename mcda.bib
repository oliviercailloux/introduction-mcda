	abstract = {In this article, we tackle the problem of exploring the structure of the data which is underlying a bipolar-valued outranking relation. More precisely, we show how the performances of alternatives and weights related to criteria can be determined from three different formulations of the bipolar-valued outranking relations, which are given beforehand.},

	abstract = {Given a finite set of alternatives, the sorting problem consists in the assignment of each alternative to one of the pre-defined categories. In this paper, we are interested in multiple criteria sorting problems and, more precisely, in the existing method {ELECTRE} {TRI.} This method requires the elicitation of parameters (weights, thresholds, category limits,...) in order to construct the {DM’s} preference model. A direct elicitation of these parameters being rather difficult, we proceed to solve this problem in a way that requires from the {DM} much less cognitive effort. We elicit these parameters indirectly using hollistic information given by the {DM} through assignment examples. We propose an interactive approach that infers the parameters of an {ELECTRE} {TRI} model from assignment examples. The determination of an {ELECTRE} {TRI} model that best restitutes the assignement examples is formulated through an optimization problem. The interactive aspect of this approach lies in the possibility given to the {DM} to revise his/her assignment examples and/or to give additional information before the optimization phase restarts.},

	isbn = {978-1-107-01394-0},
	shorttitle = {Empirical {Social} {Choice}},
	abstract = {Since Aristotle, many different theories of distributive justice have been proposed, by philosophers as well as social scientists. The typical approach within social choice theory is to assess these theories in an axiomatic way - most of the time the reader is confronted with abstract reasoning and logical deductions. This book shows that empirical insights are necessary if one wants to apply any theory of justice in the real world. It does so by confronting the main theories of distributive justice with data from (mostly) questionnaire experiments. The book starts with an extensive discussion on why empirical social choice makes sense and how it should be done. It then presents various experimental results relating to theories of distributive justice, including the Rawlsian equity axiom, Harsanyi's version of utilitarianism, utilitarianism with a floor, responsibility-sensitive egalitarianism, the claims problem and fairness in health.},
